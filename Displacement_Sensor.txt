Researching displacement sensors I came to the conclusion the best options would be either a dial indicator/gauge (see first two links) or a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). After talking to Jeff, it might make sense to design a system to work with a Raspberry Pi or similar device. The current computer in the lab does have internet access and a serial port/several USB ports/PS2 port, but we discussed replacing other sensors with more modern technology. A shield for a Raspberry Pi might give him a more modular device that allows for future IoT improvements to the soil lab than just what I'm doing. 

This sensor does exactly what we need already, but it costs $400. I'm also not sure if it has a time out function or if it can run continously, and it's unfortunately battery powered. It communicates with Bluetooth.

This sensor seems like it would be appropriate; I need to read the data sheet more and make sure there isn't a time out mode
UPDATE: This sensor is not appropriate. It takes one measurement at a time

It uses a proprietary output format, but the company offers serial output with a cable converter: https://www.mitutoyo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/E4250-264_Input-Tool.pdf

I have come to the conclusion that sensors with the appropriate resolution are mostly either LVDTs or optical sensors. Optical sensors are more expensive, but have better output options (digital). LVDTs are tricky because they typically need an AC power supply, and often give AC output. I have been avoiding these, looking for DC/DC devices. Shown below are links to a laser and an lvdt:
